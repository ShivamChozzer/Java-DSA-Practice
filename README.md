# Java-DSA-Practice
I am currently enrolled in a course where I am learning Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). As part of the course, we are given various practice questions to solve. This repository is a record of the solutions I have worked on, allowing me to track my progress and revisit the solutions for revision.
